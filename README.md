# trumpify

Donald Trump Presidential Speech Generator! Made using recursive grammars, through the Dada Engine, as well as Markov chains.

http://dev.null.org/dadaengine/manual-1.0/dada.htmlhttp://dev.null.org/dadaengine/manual-1.0/dada.html

Currently, the system gives a 50% chance of giving a Markov text, and a 50% chance to give a Dada text. Please email me at mark32587hay@gmail.com if you feel that one is significantly better than the other. (The Markov-generated texts have no newlines).

UPDATE July 12, 2015: Version 1.0! We're finally in a working state! Check it out at http://ahaym.github.io/trumpify/ !

I would avoid saving the static links as I will probably repopulate the database as I make changes to the script (which is currently in a terrible state.)
