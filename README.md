Donald Trump Presidential Speech Generator! Made using recursive grammars, through the Dada Engine.

UPDATE July 12, 2015: Version 1.0! We're finally in a working state! Check it out at http://ahaym.github.io/trumpify/ !

I would avoid saving the static links as I will probably repopulate the database as I make changes to the script (which is currently in a terrible state.)

Made for $3 by Mark Hay
